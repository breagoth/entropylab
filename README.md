# EntropyLab

EntropyLab is a self-contained Bitcoin key and wallet calculator designed for
offline, air-gapped use. It converts user-supplied entropy, seed phrases, and
private keys into wallet recovery information without intentionally sending
sensitive data to a server. The whole application is one HTML file, and its
markup passes the W3C HTML validator with zero errors.

Current version: **v1.0.0**

Official website: [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online)

## Features

When a multi-worker Vanity search stops, its next counter is the first
unfinished counter, not the sum of candidates processed across workers.
Resuming can repeat work from later buckets, but will not skip an unfinished
gap in the requested range.

CI builds and tests the Rust/WASM modules before compiling the site, then
shares those exact modules with downstream tests and artifact publication.
For local testing after Rust changes, run `npm run build:wasm` before
`npm run build && npm test`; the checked-in modules may predate the changes.

Clearing a Key or Multisig station cancels its pending derivation. Leaving
the page clears rendered seed-word copies and prevents a late derivation or
import from restoring cleared secrets. Locking the journal also invalidates
pending notebook and Key Manager imports. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for
the limits of browser-memory cleanup.

- A live **Security log** below Important shows the browser's initial
  connection status, online/offline changes, and detected browser translation
  with local timestamps. It keeps the last 100 fixed messages in page memory,
  records no wallet data, and clears when the session ends or the page is left.
  It sends no network probes; an Offline report is not proof of an air gap.
  Translation detection uses Chrome/Google's `translated-ltr` /
  `translated-rtl` document-root classes or Edge/Microsoft's `_msthash`,
  `_msttexthash`, or `_mstmutation` DOM attributes. This is best-effort
  detection after the fact using browser markers, not prevention or a
  guaranteed future browser API. Secret-bearing surfaces retain the
  preventive `translate="no"` opt-out; see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

- Accepts dice rolls, coin flips, playing-card transcripts, number-base
  transcripts (binary through base64), hexadecimal entropy, BIP39 seed
  phrases, extended keys, WIF keys, raw private keys, and Casascius mini
  private keys. Optional live chi-squared fairness analysis flags biased dice
  as rolls are entered for hashed-dice and BitBox input. D++ omits the panel
  because a complete transcript cannot reach the panel's Pearson threshold.
  Both hashed-dice methods recommend 100 rolls for a 24-word seed phrase.
  All five BIP39 phrase lengths (12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 words) are supported
  for every entropy entry method. A separate **Brain wallet — lab** mode hashes
  exact UTF-8 text with SHA-256 and uses the 32-byte digest as 256-bit BIP39
  entropy (24 words). That is not a BIP39 passphrase, not a Bitcoin Core hdseed
  or address-key backup, and not the private-key brain-wallet path (which treats
  the same hash as a secp256k1 scalar). Strength is the entropy of the text, not
  the word count. Derive Key is required; the lab does not preview the
  mnemonic while typing.
- Derives BIP39 seeds, BIP32 extended keys, wallet fingerprints, addresses,
  and Bitcoin Core-compatible descriptors. Each master fingerprint is shown
  next to its deterministic [LifeHash](https://lifehash.info) icon so two
  keys can be told apart at a glance. The icon hashes the raw fingerprint
  bytes, so it matches the image Sparrow Wallet shows for the same key.
  Every row of the address tables has a QR button that opens that address as
  a scannable QR code, so any derived address — not just the first — can be
  verified on a signing device without retyping it.
- Supports legacy, nested SegWit, native SegWit, and Taproot single-signature
  address types. Derivation-scheme presets cover the BIP44, BIP49, BIP84,
  BIP86, and six-level BIP48 layouts and label each path level accordingly.
  A custom mode accepts an arbitrary-depth BIP32 account path, keeps Bitcoin
  network selection explicit, and appends the selected branch and address
  ranges. The default derives receive and change branches `{0-1}` and address
  indexes `{0-9}`, displayed as a full BIP-88 path template. Typing `h` or `'`
  after a preset index enables its Harden control.
 - Supports numeric coin-type and account indexes for single-signature and
   multisignature derivation. Purpose, coin type, and account indexes are
   hardened by default; the starting address index is unhardened by default.
   Each can be changed independently. Coin type 0 uses Bitcoin Mainnet, coin
   type 1 uses Bitcoin Testnet, and custom indexes retain Mainnet address
   serialization. Hardened address children require private key material and
   therefore cannot be derived from multisig co-signer xpubs.
    A network picker in the header (the Bitcoin-orange coin next to the network
    name) offers Bitcoin, Testnet, Signet, and Regtest; it shows the network
    every tool is set to and switches it — address
   formats, extended key versions, WIF prefixes, and coin-type defaults all
   follow, and each menu entry spells out the checks its choice implies. The
   PSBT tools read the picker's choice directly and have no network control of
   their own. Nothing connects anywhere: the choice only picks formats, and a
   tool's own advanced fields can still override it. Every load starts on
   Mainnet again.
- Derives watch-only multisignature wallets from extended public keys without
  requiring private keys. Multisig script type and purpose are separate as
  well; conventional script choices restore their standard purpose, while
  pasted co-signer origins auto-detect and must agree with the selected path
  indexes and hardening choices. An exported wallet descriptor can also be
  pasted to repopulate the station — quorum, script type, key order, and
  co-signers; descriptors carrying private keys are refused. Addresses are
  derived from the exported
  output descriptor itself by rust-miniscript (in the WASM crate), so the two
  cannot drift.
- Inspects PSBT v0 transactions (paste, or upload a binary .psbt / hex or
  base64 text export; the loaded bytes download as .psbt or .txn), reports
  PSBT-provided amounts and fees, checks
  for repeated ECDSA nonces from the same public key — including signatures
  carried by finalized scriptSig/witness fields, which are decoded and analyzed
  rather than skipped — verifies optional Jade
  anti-exfil (sign-to-contract) transcripts without a key, and can compare supported
  SegWit v0 SIGHASH_ALL signatures with RFC 6979, including Bitcoin Core-style low-r grinding, in a temporary session.
  Every input's declared sighash policy and each signature's appended sighash
  byte are decoded without a key; anything other than exact SIGHASH_ALL (or
  Taproot's equivalent SIGHASH_DEFAULT) is a
  blocking warning. Finalized signatures that cannot be decoded or associated
  with a key block any clean nonce verdict. The report gives each check a
  completed, problem, or incomplete state and gives an overall incomplete
  result whenever required data or support is missing. “Completed” describes
  only that check against the data in the file; it is not a claim that the
  transaction is safe or that PSBT-provided data is true.
- Accepts a fully signed raw Bitcoin transaction (hex or base64) in the same
  inspector: outputs, extracted ECDSA nonces, and inscription-envelope hints.
  Fee and RFC 6979 cannot be checked without previous outputs.
- Keeps an optional cross-session ECDSA nonce history in page memory and lets
  the user download or upload it as versioned JSON. The file contains only
  the check time, master fingerprint when available, raw `r`, a
  domain-separated SHA-256 tag for the exact signing key, a tagged message or
  source identity, and a verification flag — never the PSBT, transaction,
  signature, public key, or message digest. The exact-key tag prevents child
  keys sharing a master fingerprint from being conflated. It can confirm reuse
  only when the same key/`r` pair has different verified message digests;
  incomplete records produce a warning instead. The file is
  correlation-sensitive metadata and should remain offline. Nothing persists
  unless it is downloaded.
- With a session seed, root xprv, WIF, or hex key, labels each output as
  change, receive, or not in this wallet (accounts 0–2, 50 receive + 50
  change, all four script types). A two-or-more-output transaction with no
  matching change is a blocking warning. OP_RETURN outputs are decoded for size and a text/hex
  preview; the tool does not create data-carrier outputs.
- Scans PSBT tap-leaf scripts and finalized witnesses for inscription envelopes
  (`OP_FALSE OP_IF "ord"`). Reports content-type, size, and text previews; does
  not number sats, fetch chain data, create inscriptions, or render images.
- Edits PSBT v0 and v2 (BIP-370) files field by field (a bip174.org-style
  editor backed by
  rust-bitcoin compiled to WebAssembly): a mempool.space-style
  transaction-flow diagram draws one box per input and output (claimed
  amount, address or script template, signing status) with per-column totals
  and bezier connectors into the unsigned transaction; selecting a box opens
  that key-value map for editing in a panel under the diagram, the
  transaction box opens the version/locktime fields, and output amounts edit
  directly in their boxes. Every key-value pair of the global,
  per-input, and per-output maps is decoded (BIP-174 and BIP-371 taproot
  fields), editable as raw hex, and removable, new pairs can be added, and the
  unsigned transaction's version, locktime, input prevouts/sequences, and
  output amounts/scripts get structured fields. Fields longer than 64
  characters (a whole previous transaction, a large script) collapse to a
  truncated preview with a length label; clicking the cell opens the full
  text in an editor window, where values stay editable. Re-serialization is
  validated by rust-bitcoin before the edited PSBT is shown. A second PSBT can
  be pasted for a semantic comparison against the editor's: the underlying
  transaction, the signing state, and the PSBT metadata are diffed separately
  on the decoded contents, so reordered map serialization is not reported as
  a change. The comparison reports differences only; it does not judge
  whether a change is safe. An edited PSBT too large for a static QR code is
  shown as an animated `ur:crypto-psbt` fragment sequence for air-gapped
  scanning, and an **Insane editing** switch lifts the consensus-layer checks
  for deliberately broken files while still listing their problems. The
  editor never signs anything.
- Derives BIP-85 child entropy from the active key's BIP32 root (or a pasted
  root xprv): English BIP-39 mnemonics (12–24 words), HD-seed WIF, XPRV, HEX,
  and Base64/Base85 passwords. Same parent, application, and index always
  reproduce the same child — this is a calculator, not a generator. Children
  follow the published BIP-85 vectors and match COLDCARD, including derivation
  from a passphrase-extended root when a BIP-39 passphrase is in effect.
  Unremoved BIP-39 and XPRV children can be selected as HD roots in BIP-85,
  Silent Payments, Vanity, PSBT/Nonce inspection, and multisig; WIF children
  can be selected for PSBT/Nonce inspection. Their pickers show the parent
  LifeHash, an arrow, then the child LifeHash and fingerprint. Deleting a child
  removes its picker options and wipes any private sessions loaded from it.
  Vanity matches from an immutable child can be searched and copied, but not
  written back to that child.
- Derives BIP-352 Silent Payment addresses (`sp1q…` / `tsp1q…`) from a seed or
  root xprv, including labeled codes, BIP-392 `spscan` / `spspend` descriptors,
  sender taproot outputs from pasted vin JSON, and receiver verification of
  pasted x-only outputs. Prints a BIP-321 `bitcoin:?sp=` URI and the BIP-353
  DNS TXT to paste on a domain you control; paste that URI back on Send.
  Hybrid URIs with an ordinary Bitcoin fallback address still use Silent
  Payments; the results identify the fallback address as not used.
  This is a calculator: it does not scan the chain or resolve names.
- Grinds vanity addresses for a Key Station key or a compatible BIP-85 child
  (Vanity tab), picked through the same chip picker as BIP-85 and Silent
  Payments. Two methods: the **passphrase grind** extends the key's BIP39
  passphrase with base-62 odometer counter characters, the **derivation grind**
  keeps the passphrase and steps through BIP32 account indexes. Every
  candidate is derived the standard way (PBKDF2 seed, BIP32 path — the key's
  own purpose, account, branch, and address index) in a dedicated WebAssembly module, one Web Worker
  per CPU core, and its mainnet address of the selected type (legacy, nested
  SegWit, native SegWit, Taproot, or a BIP-352 Silent Payment code) is checked
  against the chosen prefix. For Silent Payment codes, the first custom
  character is limited to `g f 2 t v d w 0`; later characters can use the
  full Bech32 alphabet. A short timing sample on tab entry (fixed
  published constants, never the session's keys) turns the odds into an
  expected time to a match, and **Stop on first find** halts the grind at the
  first hit. Same key and counter always reproduce the same
  address, so nothing is invented. For a Key Station source, **Update key**
  writes a found passphrase or account index back to the key and re-derives it,
  so the Keys tab, its exports, and the Journal show the vanity wallet. BIP-85
  children stay unchanged. Found passphrases stay in
  page memory, are masked until revealed, and are wiped with the session.
- Derives Lightning node identity public keys (a Lightning tab held back from
  release navigation while its UI is polished) from a seed
  phrase: an LND 24-word **aezeed** cipher seed is deciphered in WebAssembly
  (scrypt key derivation, AEZ v5, CRC-32C checksum; a wrong passphrase is
  detected, unlike BIP39) and its entropy derives the node key at LND's
  `m/1017'/coinType'/6'/0/0` keychain path, while a BIP-39 phrase follows the
  ldk-node convention (BIP39 seed, master key, re-seeded second BIP32 tree,
  node secret at `m/0'`). The decoded cipher seed's internal version and
  wallet birthday are shown alongside the node key; the decoded entropy and
  salt and the BIP32 root xprv (what `chantools showrootkey` prints) sit
  behind a reveal toggle. Decoding only: the tab never creates seeds.
- A session **Journal** (temporarily hidden from release navigation while its
  backup and restore flow is polished) holds an **Entropy
  Journal** notebook, a notepad stamped with this computer's date and time,
  a Key Manager, a live summary of everything derived in this sitting, and a debug log
  of tool switches and derives (fingerprints, not seeds). Its introduction
  remains above the Journal controls. Notepad, Key manager, Session state, and Session log
  stay visible but disabled until the user creates a journal, with or without
  a password, or successfully opens an existing journal; the create/open gate
  then disappears and the Journal starts on Notepad. The create form reports
  whether password protection is enabled and checks confirmation matches live
  without exposing what was typed. A blank password is accepted and provides
  no access protection: anyone holding the resulting file can open it by
  leaving the password blank. Journal-wide **Download journal** and **Clear journal** actions stay
  below the introduction once a journal is unlocked; clearing wipes the
  entries, notepad, session snapshot, and log from page memory and
  returns to the create/open gate. The notebook keeps
  entropy the user already produced — dice, coins, hex, brain-wallet text, or
  a seed — under AES-256-GCM; the key is PBKDF2-SHA-256 (600,000 rounds) of the
  optional password the user chooses, with the salt derived from that password
  and the IV HMAC-SHA-256 of the plaintext, so the file is a pure function of
  password and entries and no CSPRNG is ever called. One JSON file the user
  downloads and loads back. Nothing is stored in the browser; download a file
  to keep it. Closing the page discards the sitting. The notebook is a
  calculator companion, not a password manager: it only stores material the
  user generated themselves.
  The **Key manager** tab packages selected Key Station source inputs and
  settings, including ignored entries, into an `.elkeys` file. It reuses the unlocked
  Journal's password setting, so it adds no password prompt, random salt,
  or random nonce. Imports are **unverified inputs**, not ready-to-use wallets.
  Choose **Load inputs to derive**, review the inputs/settings, then derive each
  key in Key Station. Cached addresses, private outputs, and fingerprints from
  legacy files are discarded; only fresh derivation can match an existing key.
  **Add all to Key Station** applies only to already-derived keys, leaving
  unverified and ignored entries untouched. New files use input-only format
  version 2 (requires this updated reader); version 1 files remain importable.
  Cached-output-only files cannot replace missing source inputs.
  Deleting a Key Station tab while a Journal is open
  likewise removes it from the station without discarding it from Key Manager.
  The Journal also includes a paged notepad. Pages use
  the Key Station's numbered naming convention, can be added or removed with
  the +/− controls, and can be renamed by activating the selected page again
  or pressing F2. Default names such as `Page 1` shorten to `P1` in narrow
  windows. A responsive control row below the editor sets each page's
  typeface, text size, and line spacing. Its key picker lists the currently
  derived Key Station keys with their LifeHashes; choosing one inserts a
  public inline reference with a line-height LifeHash and master fingerprint.
  Notepad, Session state, and Session log downloads use the unlocked Journal's
  file encryption by default. If the Journal has a password, that password
  protects the downloads; without one, the encoded downloads have no access
  protection. Their matching checkboxes stay synchronized, so one change applies
  to Notepad, Session state, and Session log; unchecking exports the original
  plain JSON or text. Notepad can upload either its plain notebook JSON or its
  Journal-format export while that journal is unlocked.
  Each page opens
  with a live local timestamp and freezes it when note text is entered. Delete
  the note back to its timestamp to return to the live new-note prompt. Press
  Enter after a note to open the next live timestamp and prompt. Press Enter on
  that empty prompt to leave an unstamped blank line and move a fresh live
  prompt to the line below. Delete at the empty prompt moves it back through
  those blank lines; once it reaches a completed note, the empty timestamp and
  prompt disappear and the caret returns to that note's end. Clicking any blank
  line moves an untouched live note there, or inserts a new live note there if
  the last note is already written; dragging across blank lines only selects
  them. Deleting a selected bottom section opens a live prompt on the blank line
  left at the caret. Clicking a written note cancels an untouched pending note
  and keeps the caret where clicked. Moving the pointer over the editor briefly
  reveals its clipboard button at the right edge; the same control is reachable
  from the keyboard and copies the active page as readable text. **Download notebook** writes versioned
  UTF-8 JSON containing page names, styles, and structured text/key runs; it
  stores only the key's display name and public fingerprint, then regenerates
  the LifeHash locally when that file is uploaded in a later session. Older
  `.txt` notes can also be uploaded as a single page. The Journal also holds
  a read-only summary that updates as the sitting changes and a debug log of
  meaningful dashboard actions: tool and station changes, calculations and
  failures, safe setting changes, copies, imports, downloads, clears, and PSBT
  structural edits. The log records public fingerprints where useful, but never
  secret-field values, filenames, note bodies, PSBT bytes, or individual entry
  keystrokes. It can be copied from its output field or downloaded. Nothing is stored in the
  browser; download a file to keep it. Closing the page discards the sitting.
- Runs a quick barrage of startup sanity checks on the host browser (secure
  context, CSPRNG, BigInt, UTF-8 encoding, NFKD, and WebAssembly). If any
  check fails, the page is replaced with a failure report listing the failed
  checks, because wallet output from a broken host cannot be trusted.
  iPhone/iPad/Mac Lockdown Mode blocks WebAssembly (the secp256k1 engine):
  exclude the site in Safari's page menu, or open the saved HTML in Firefox
  on an air-gapped computer. There is no JavaScript secp256k1 fallback.
- Before any input is wired, runs published test vectors (BIP39 encoding and
  seed, BIP32 private and public derivation, the BIP44/49/84/86 first receive
  addresses, and an RFC 6979 ECDSA signature and its verification) through the
  same WebAssembly engine the calculator uses, and kills the page the same way
  if this browser computes any of them wrong. The separate PSBT module gets the
  same treatment once it loads: BIP-174 and BIP-370 decodes, a byte-exact
  rebuild through the editor's own path, rejection of an invalid file, and the
  BIP-341 Taproot sighash-byte rule. It catches a miscompiling engine
  or a corrupted copy; it cannot catch an exploit aimed at the vectors
  themselves, so for anything that matters, compare the master fingerprint and
  first address against a second browser or signing device too.
- Produces recovery information that can be saved or printed for offline use.
- Exports a Bitcoin Core `wallet.dat` (SQLite descriptor wallet) with every
  derived output descriptor already imported — receive and change for each
  script type, active and ready for address generation. The default download
  is watch-only; while private recovery material is shown on screen, the
  export becomes the spending variant (account xprvs as descriptor keys) and
  the button says so. The descriptor birthday defaults to genesis so
  recovered keys are discovered by Bitcoin Core's initial scan; choose the
  "New keys" birthday only for entropy created at that moment. If a loaded
  wallet looks empty, repair it with `rescanblockchain 0` in Bitcoin Core.
  Generated database files match Bitcoin Core's own record layout
  byte-for-byte (verified against Bitcoin Core v28.3.0).
- A derived multisig can export a watch-only Bitcoin Core `wallet.dat` (same
  SQLite descriptor wallet as Key Station, never with private keys) and the
  `importdescriptors` JSON for a blank `disable_private_keys` wallet. Drop the
  `.dat` in `wallets/<name>/` and `loadwallet`, or feed the JSON to
  `bitcoin-cli importdescriptors`. A derived multisig also prints and saves a
  one-page watch-only policy sheet (network, `m-of-n`, co-signer fingerprints,
  descriptor checksum, receive address 0) so every signer can verify the
  policy before funding, and a BIP 388 wallet policy (template + xpubs) for
  wallets that register policies. Calculator export, not a generator.
- On a derived key, **Edit Input** loads its inputs into Key Station.
  **Derive New Key** creates a separate tab, including for identical inputs.
  The secondary action, **Update Existing Key**, replaces only that source
  tab after successful derivation. Custom tab names survive updates; a tab
  still named for its fingerprint follows the key if that fingerprint changes.
- MS Station keeps a session key selected when its co-signer derivation path
  changes. Clicking that selected key removes it; using it on another
  co-signer still requires opting into key reuse and distinct derivation paths.
  On a derived multisig, **Edit Input** loads its inputs into MS Station.
  **Derive New Multisig** creates a separate tab and preserves existing
  multisigs, even when the inputs are identical. The secondary action,
  **Update Existing Multisig**, replaces that source tab after successful
  derivation.
  Multisig tabs display their saved names, including renames; updating an
  existing multisig preserves its name, and the edit note identifies it by
  its current tab name.
- An optional **Sync entropy across methods** checkbox (off by default) keeps
  direct dice, card, number-base, seed-word, and private-key representations in
  sync while input is entered. Each destination waits for enough bits to emit
  its next complete character. Hashed inputs update the non-hashed methods in
  one direction; edits to non-hashed methods never overwrite hashed inputs.
  With sync off, every dice-roll method retains its own independent transcript.
- SLIP-132 extended-key display is a prefix swap only (same payload, new
  version bytes and checksum). Import/derive shows the key as pasted, the
  account xpub/tpub, any account private-key export, and the descriptor
  (script in the descriptor, not the prefix). The master xpub/tpub is at `m`;
  the account xpub/tpub is at the selected account path. A generic xprv is
  re-prefixed only when the path/script match: x = legacy, y = nested BIP49,
  z = native BIP84, Y = nested BIP48 multisig, Z = native BIP48 native-msig.
  Testnet uses t / u / v / U / V. There is no Taproot SLIP prefix.
- Gates each release behind a two-step disclaimer: the first step warns that
  the software is experimental, and the second names what the browser cannot
  protect (keys paged to disk, clipboard history, memory surviving close) and
  unlocks only after the reader types a proof digit — derived from how long
  the warning was read, never from a CSPRNG. Acceptance is remembered per
  version, so each new release asks again.
- Guards the session with just-in-time warnings: deriving from less entropy
  than recommended requires an explicit confirmation, and a newly derived key
  whose master fingerprint matches another open key asks before it is kept.
  While the page is offline, external reference links open as QR codes to
  scan with an online device instead of navigating.
- Offers optional on-screen keyboards for mouse-only entry of seed words,
  passphrases, private keys, and Base64/Base32 text, and a footer toggle
  between dark and light themes.
- Speaks five languages: a header selector switches the interface between
  English, German, Spanish, French, and Portuguese, with untranslated strings
  falling back to English.

## Usage

Download the self-contained `entropylab.html` from the
[official website](https://entropylab.online) or the
[releases page](https://github.com/OogaBoogaX/entropylab/releases), transfer it to a trusted
computer, disconnect that computer from all networks, and open the file in a
modern browser. For sensitive wallet material, use a dedicated air-gapped
machine and verify important addresses and descriptors with an independent
wallet or signing device before receiving funds. Before loading a real key, work
through the [computer hardening checklist](docs/Computer_Hardening_Checklist.md).

To build the HTML file yourself, see [Building from source](#building-from-source).

### Feature guide

Choose **Guide** above the tool tabs for an eight-step beginner walkthrough
or individual feature lessons. **Explain this tool** in each released tool's
introduction opens its lesson directly. Every step explains the feature,
what to check, and its limits. No wallet secrets are needed. Optional goal-based
routes group lessons with summaries; **New here? Start with the basics** opens the beginner route and Browse all lessons keeps direct access. Expandable diagrams
and ungraded quick checks live only inside Guide and never block progress. Each check appears once, after its lesson concepts. First-use basics terms have expandable explanations.

Back, Contents, Close, and replay are always available. Closing retains your
place for this page session; **Continue learning** resumes an unfinished lesson. After a route lesson finishes, an explicit **Continue route** action opens the next lesson. Finish screens also link to feature lessons, without opening tools. Reloading or
leaving the page resets progress. Completing a lesson never removes Guide.
The lessons are bundled in the downloaded HTML and work without network or
browser storage. New lesson translations fall back to English until the
translation workflow fills them.

Reading lessons does not derive, reveal, import, or change wallet material.
**Open this tool** explicitly leaves the guide and uses normal tool
navigation, which can change displayed results and runs Vanity's usual
benchmark on entry. The guide explains limitations; it does not certify a
wallet, transaction, or computer safe.

### iPhone home-screen app

On iPhone, open [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online) in Safari, then
choose **Share → Add to Home Screen → Open as Web App → Add**. Keep the page
open until its first load completes. The hosted app stores the self-contained
calculator in a versioned browser cache so the Home Screen app can reopen when
the phone has no network connection.

Before entering any seed phrase, private key, or other secret wallet material,
disconnect every network available to the phone, reopen EntropyLab from the
Home Screen, and confirm that the header reports **Offline**. A cached page is
not proof of an air gap: the status is based on browser network signals, and the
hosted worker checks for application updates whenever the app is opened while
connected. Clearing Safari website data or removing the Home Screen app may
remove the cached copy.

For sensitive or long-term use, the recommended path remains the downloaded,
verified `entropylab.html` on a dedicated air-gapped computer. The downloaded
file is still self-contained and never registers the hosted service worker.

### Verifying the download

Every merge to `rock` publishes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` checksum manifest for
`entropylab.html` (committed next to it in this repository), a matching
`CID.txt` (CIDv1 raw sha2-256 of those same bytes), a
[GitHub artifact attestation](https://github.com/OogaBoogaX/entropylab/attestations)
for the exact bytes built by CI, and an OpenTimestamps proof
(`entropylab.html.ots`) of that same digest. After downloading, verify:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
gh attestation verify entropylab.html -R OogaBoogaX/entropylab
```

The three WASM modules embedded in the HTML are committed as
`src/js/*-wasm-b64.js`; their digests are in `WASM-SHA256SUMS.txt`, committed
next to `SHA256SUMS.txt`. From a checkout of the release commit:

```sh
sha256sum -c WASM-SHA256SUMS.txt
```

The build is also **reproducible**: `entropylab.html` rebuilds byte-for-byte
from the source commit stamped in its footer, so "CI built these bytes from
that source" can be checked instead of trusted. Docker is the only
prerequisite — the pinned development image is the canonical build
environment (fixed Node, Rust, and clang):

```sh
git checkout <stamped-commit>   # the commit shown in the file's footer
docker compose run --rm dev bash -c "npm ci --ignore-scripts && npm run build"
sha256sum entropylab.html       # compare with SHA256SUMS.txt
```

This rebuilds the HTML from source using the committed WASM modules as fixed
inputs. Rebuilding those modules (`npm run build:wasm` inside the same image)
uses the image's pinned clang. CI requires two such builds to match the
modules it publishes: the artifact commit and the Pages deploy wait for that
check. A host clang build is not those bytes. Rebuilds on other machines that
matched the published hashes, the page and the modules alike, are recorded in
[docs/Reproductions.md](docs/Reproductions.md), with how to add one.

The checksum detects accidental corruption. The attestation (Sigstore) says
this repository's CI built those bytes. OpenTimestamps says the digest
existed as of a Bitcoin block, independently of GitHub. A newly committed
`.ots` is a *pending* calendar receipt, not a timestamp — do not call it
stamped until `ots info entropylab.html.ots` shows a Bitcoin attestation.
Then, on a machine with Bitcoin Core (a pruned node is fine):

```sh
ots verify entropylab.html
```

On **Windows**, `opentimestamps-client`'s `python-bitcoinlib` dependency
looks for OpenSSL as `libeay32.dll`, which stock Windows does not provide
(`LoadLibrary() argument 1 must be str, not None`). No full OpenSSL install
is needed: Git for Windows already ships it. Copy
`libcrypto-3-x64.dll` (and `libssl-3-x64.dll`) from
`C:\Program Files\Git\mingw64\bin\` into any PATH directory as
`libeay32.dll` and verification runs natively.

EntropyLab itself never stamps, upgrades, or verifies `.ots` files and never
talks to a calendar. The HTML stays air-gappable.

The CID is a self-describing name for the SHA-256, not a second hash. The
calculator never talks to IPFS. To store or fetch the file on a **local**
node without GitHub or `entropylab.online` DNS:

```sh
ipfs block put --cid-codec=raw --allow-big-block entropylab.html   # pin the bytes you already verified
ipfs get -o entropylab.html "$(cut -d' ' -f1 CID.txt)"             # retrieve by CID
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt
```

`ipfs add` (UnixFS chunking) produces a different CID; that is expected.
Public gateways may refuse a multi-megabyte raw block — a local node is the
intended path. Never open a gateway URL as the wallet origin. Do not put
seeds or other private material on IPFS.

The attestation is keyless (Sigstore) and bound to this repository's release
workflow, so it authenticates the artifact independently of the hosting
account. The checksum manifest alone only detects accidental corruption —
always pair it with the attestation or reproduce the build from reviewed
source. For a given Git revision, `npm run build` deterministically assembles
`entropylab.html` from committed inputs, including the committed WASM modules;
the revision to check out is stamped in the generated file. Rebuilding those
modules from their Rust/C sources (`npm run build:wasm`) is separate: CI
asserts it inside the pinned image, and
[docs/Reproductions.md](docs/Reproductions.md) records the rebuilds on other
machines. CI also runs the WASM binding tests against the fresh build (see
[Building from source](#building-from-source)).

An online version is available at [entropylab.online](https://entropylab.online)
for convenient access. Do not enter seed phrases, private keys, or other secret
wallet material into an internet-connected device; use the downloaded HTML on
a trusted air-gapped computer for sensitive operations.

EntropyLab does not generate wallet entropy, and it does not use browser
randomness anywhere. The BitBox and D++ coin-flip steps record a fixed
equivalent die face: any face in the Heads range derives the same word as any
other, so that choice never changes the resulting entropy. Wallet security
still depends on the quality and secrecy of the entropy, seed phrase,
passphrase, or private key supplied by the user.

## FAQ

### Does EntropyLab generate a seed or private key for me?

No. EntropyLab deterministically transforms entropy or key material that you
supply. It does not create secret wallet entropy. BIP-85 children are derived
from the parent root you provide and are reproducible from that same root,
application, and index.

### Can I enter a real seed phrase on the website?

Do not enter wallet secrets on an internet-connected device. Download the
self-contained HTML, verify it, transfer it to a trusted air-gapped computer,
and open it there. Keep backups and verify important results independently
before receiving funds.

### Does EntropyLab replace a hardware wallet or signing device?

No. EntropyLab is a calculator and verification tool. It can derive recovery
information, construct watch-only wallet data, and inspect supported PSBT
details, but it is not intended to be a transaction signer or broadcaster.
Use a separately verified wallet or signing device when spending bitcoin.

### How should I check an address or descriptor before using it?

Derive the same wallet with an independent implementation or signing device
and compare the address, derivation path, fingerprint, and descriptor. Do not
rely on matching only a shortened value or a visual icon.

### How do I know the downloaded HTML is authentic?

Follow [Verifying the download](#verifying-the-download). Check the SHA-256
manifest together with the GitHub artifact attestation, or build the file from
the reviewed source. A checksum by itself detects changed bytes but does not
authenticate who produced them.

### Why does EntropyLab accept short dice or card transcripts?

Short inputs are useful for deterministic tests, demonstrations, and recovery
experiments, so they are accepted with a warning. Hashing a short transcript
does not add entropy. Never secure funds with an input below the displayed
recommendation.

### How should I report a possible security problem?

Do not open a public issue for a suspected vulnerability involving incorrect
derivations, secret exposure, injected code, unexpected network access, or
possible loss of funds. Follow the private reporting instructions in
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Building from source

The build bundles the application with esbuild and inlines the result into a
single self-contained HTML file. The wallet cryptographic primitives run in
WebAssembly from the pinned Rust crates (below). The JavaScript bundle also
includes `uqr` (QR rendering) and `@scure/btc-signer` through
`src/js/script-builder.js`, which the PSBT editor uses to convert supplied
addresses to output scripts. Its bundled dependencies are part of the
production audit surface, even though the package is listed under
`devDependencies`. The `@noble`/`@scure` packages also serve as differential
test oracles; they are not exclusively test-only. `package-lock.json` pins
the complete dependency tree and the integrity hash of every downloaded
package.

EntropyLab's cryptography — secp256k1 curve operations (public-key
derivation, ECDSA signing and verification in PSBT inspection, curve point
math), hashes (SHA-256, SHA-512, RIPEMD-160, HMAC-SHA-512,
PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512), BIP32 extended-key derivation, BIP39 mnemonics,
Base58Check and bech32m encoding, output descriptor evaluation
(BIP380-386; taproot `sortedmulti_a` is layered on top), and
address/script construction
(p2pkh/p2sh/p2wpkh/p2tr, bare and taproot multisig) — runs on rust-bitcoin's
`secp256k1` crate (libsecp256k1 v0.4.1 vendored by secp256k1-sys 0.10.1),
`bitcoin`, `bitcoin_hashes`, `base58ck`, `bech32`, `bip39`, and
`miniscript`, compiled to
WebAssembly from the pinned Rust crate in `entropylab-wasm/` (exact crate
versions in `entropylab-wasm/Cargo.lock`, toolchain pinned by
`rust-toolchain.toml`) via the facades in `src/js/secp256k1.js`,
`src/js/hashes.js`, `src/js/hdkey.js`, `src/js/bip39.js`, `src/js/base58.js`,
`src/js/addresses.js`, and `src/js/bech32.js`. The PSBT editor and flow
visualizer render script addresses through the WASM `addressFromScript`
facade; the script builder's address-to-script conversion is the JavaScript
exception described above. The compiled artifact is committed as `src/js/entropylab-wasm-b64.js`, so building the
site needs only Node.js. CI
rebuilds it inside the pinned dev image, runs its test suite against the
fresh build, and commits that copy back to `rock` after each merge (the
same flow as the site artifact). The image pins clang; a host clang build
is not that copy. Build-host paths are remapped out of the binary.
[docs/Reproductions.md](docs/Reproductions.md) records the rebuilds of the
published hashes in that image on other machines.

PSBT parsing, typed field decoding, and re-serialization in the PSBT editor
run on rust-bitcoin 0.32.102 compiled to WebAssembly from the pinned crate in
`psbt-wasm/` (same pinning rules), exposed through `src/js/psbt-wasm.js` and
committed as `src/js/psbt-wasm-b64.js`. The WASM sees only PSBT bytes and
UTF-8 JSON; it holds no keys and generates no randomness.

Requirements: Node.js 20.19 or newer.

```sh
npm ci
npm run build
```

To modify the Rust bindings (`entropylab-wasm/`, `psbt-wasm/`, `vanity-wasm/`),
Rust (with the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target, installed automatically by
rustup) is also required; regenerate the committed artifacts with
`npm run build:wasm`.

Build output (generated; CI rebuilds it for every run and commits it back to
`rock` after each merge so the file stays downloadable from the repository):

- `entropylab.html` — the self-contained application (open this file)

The version is declared once in `package.json` and substituted into the
output at build time. The generated file is gitignored locally; CI builds
it before every test run and commits it back to `rock` after each merge.
To remove generated files, run `npm run clean`.

## Development and deployment

The toolchain is npm and Node.js (>=20.19). Install the exact dependency tree
with `npm ci`; every local and CI operation is exposed as an npm script:

```bash
npm test                    # run all tests, including the headless-Firefox suite
npm run test:ci             # the CI subset: network-check, ui-defaults, source invariants
npm run test:validate       # validate source and security invariants
npm run test:browser        # test crypto, sanitization, networking, exports in headless Firefox
npm run build               # compile src/ into the generated root files
npm run build:wasm          # rebuild the committed crypto WASM artifact (needs Rust)
npm run verify              # verify the site artifact (entropylab.html, assets)
npm run ci                  # run the CI test subset, build, and verify in order
```

GitHub Actions builds the site first, then runs the same test steps for pull
requests and pushes to `rock`, stages the verified site (`entropylab.html`,
`assets/`) and deploys it to GitHub Pages. After a merge to
`rock`, a final job commits the rebuilt `entropylab.html`
back to the repository so the file stays downloadable; pull requests never
carry the generated output, so they stop conflicting on it. The staging step
copies the verified `entropylab.html` to a deployment-only `index.html`,
allowing both the site root and `/entropylab.html` to serve the same
application without committing a second application artifact. CI runs the
test suites that need no browser; the headless-Firefox suite runs locally
where a Firefox binary is available. Local checks and CI/CD use the same
commands; the workflow contains no separate build implementation.

The browser suite runs the assembled application in headless Firefox against a
local Node.js HTTP server. It feeds hostile markup and event-handler strings
through user-facing fields, verifies the application makes no network
requests at runtime, exercises the hosted warning and
assets, derives a known wallet through the UI, and inspects both watch-only
and private recovery-sheet exports. It also runs the BIP39 and BIP32 published
vectors directly against the application code. It is the only part of the
toolchain that needs a browser; the server, build, and test harness are
dependency-free Node.js.
